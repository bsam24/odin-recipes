        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The pumpkin pie recipe from Preppy Kitchen is definitely worth trying, and here are some reasons why:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The recipe is easy to follow and includes step-by-step instructions with photos</li>
            <li>The pie crust is flaky and delicious, and the filling is smooth and spiced with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves</li>
            <li>The recipe uses canned pumpkin puree, which is convenient and easy to find, but you can also use homemade pumpkin puree if you prefer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>pie crust</li>
            <li>brown sugar</li>
            <li>spices</li>
            <li>pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>evaporated milk</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll a disk of homemade dough into a 14-inch circle, line a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan, crimp the edges, and freeze the crust for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Line with parchment paper and fill with weights. Bake for 15 minutes at 425F. Remove parchment and weights and let cool before proceeding with 
                the filling. Store-bought crusts like preshaped frozen pie shells or Pillsbury pie crust sheets do not need to be blind-baked.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, spices, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the pumpkin and evaporated milk to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs.</li>
            <li>Whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour into the pie shell.</li>
            <li>You can brush the edges of the pie crust with an egg wash if you desire. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350F. 
                Continue baking until the filling is puffed and jiggles slightly in the center when gently shaken. Remove the pumpkin pie 
                from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>

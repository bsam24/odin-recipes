        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg flour 00</li>
            <li>600 ml water</li>
            <li>3 gr dried yeast</li>
            <li>15 gr salt</li>
            <li>fresh tomato</li>
            <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the dough for the pizza, start pouring the flour in a large mixer bowl.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl add luke-warm water and then add the yeast, mixing gently until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Turn the mixer on with the hook mounted on medium-to-low speed and start pouring the water little by little, 
                making sure you wait for the previous dose to be absorbed by the flour.</li>
            <li>Keep kneading until the dough gets smooth and homogeneous. When it gets to that point, keep kneading for about 15/20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and keep the mixer running until the salt is fully combined with the dough.</li>
            <li>When the salt is fully absorbed, remove the dough from the mixer and knead with your hands until you get a large ball.</li>
            <li>Place it in a large bowl, cover with foil or a clean humid cloth, then let it rise in the oven with the light on.</li>
            <li>Wait until the mixture has at least doubled in volume (after 1.5 h). Ideally, you should let it triple in size (at least 3 hours).</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, transfer it on a work surface.</li>
            <li>Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them as balls using your hands. Once done, cover them with a clean cloth 
                and let them stand for 30 minutes at room temperature, before using them to make your pizzas.</li>
        </ol>
